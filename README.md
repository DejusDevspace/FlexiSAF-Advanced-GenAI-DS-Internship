This repository contains my project/deliverables portfolio for the **FlexiSAF Generative AI and Data Science Internship - Advanced Learning Path.**

## üìÅ **Task Portfolio**

### [**MODULE 1: Advanced Machine Learning Techniques**](./task1/)

The deliverable for module 1 can be found in the [task1](./task1) folder. It contains the implementation of multiple advanced Machine Learning techniques like **Ensemble learning, Hyperparameter Optimization, Deep Learning**, e.t.c., to solve a wine quality prediction problem. The outcome of the task is `Custom meta-learning ensemble with a neural network combiner`.

**Techniques Demonstrated:**
- ‚úÖ Ensemble Learning (RandomForest + LightGBM)
- ‚úÖ Deep Learning (Neural Network Meta-Learner) 
- ‚úÖ Hyperparameter Optimization (RandomizedSearchCV)
- ‚úÖ Meta-Learning (Out-of-fold predictions with cross-validation)

**Performance Achievement**: ~0.99 ROC-AUC with custom ensemble architecture

### [**MODULE 2: Deep Learning for Image Captioning**](./task2/)

The deliverable for module 2 can be found in the [task2](./task2) folder. It contains two projects:
- The implementation of an **Image Captioning model** using PyTorch that automatically generates descriptive captions for images. The model uses an **Encoder-Decoder architecture** with a pre-trained ResNet50 CNN as the encoder and an LSTM network as the decoder.
- The implementation of DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm to solve the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent learns to balance a pole on a cart by taking actions based on the state of the environment.

**Techniques Demonstrated:**
- ‚úÖ Deep Learning (Encoder-Decoder with Attention)
- ‚úÖ Reinforcement Learning (DQN for CartPole-v1)
- ‚úÖ Image Captioning (Encoder-Decoder with Attention)
- ‚úÖ Transfer Learning (Pre-trained ResNet50)
- ‚úÖ Sequence Generation (LSTM for captioning)
- ‚úÖ Reinforcement Learning (DQN for CartPole-v1)
- ‚úÖ Experience Replay (Stabilizing DQN training)
- ‚úÖ Target Network (Improving DQN stability)

**Performance Achievement**: BLEU-4 score of ~0.31 for image captioning and successful training of DQN agent to balance the pole.
